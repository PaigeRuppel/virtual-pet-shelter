<h1>Virtual Pet Shelter!</h1>

+ At the Virtual Pet Shelter, you are responsible for caring for many animals' needs

+ All of the animals are unique with a name, type, and short description

+ Each animal has basic needs including hunger, thirst, and boredom

+ You can take care of these needs by carrying out basic commands

+ You can also adopt out and intake new pets

+ Pay attention to the needs of all of the animals - if needs are too high, they will not be desirable to adopt

+ If any of your pets needs reaches 100, your pet will die

+ The game continues until all of the pets are out of your shelter.

+ To exit the game at any time, type "quit"
